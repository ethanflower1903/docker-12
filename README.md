What is Docker?
Docker is an open-source container technology can be used to automate the deployment process which packages, deploys, and runs applications in any environment.

Origin of Docker
Docker, Inc. is an American technology company that develops Docker Hub and Docker Desktop. The company was founded as dotCloud, Inc. in 2010 by Solomon Hykes. Docker, Inc. started its life as platform ad a service (PaaS) provide called dotCloud. Behind the scenes, the dotCloud platform leveraged Linux contained. To help them create and manage these containers they built an internal tool that they called it as "Docker." And that's how Docker was born!

What is container?
Container is an operating system (OS) virtualization based on Linux namespaces and cgroups.  Containers don not need a separate operating system, applications inside containers dependent on host operating system. But, process, files, libraries and configurations contained inside containers are isolated from other process that runs in operating system. Every container has its own process stack, its own IP address.

Before container technologies, deploying an application usually took quite a long time. The deployment had to be done manually, which cost the company time and resources. Sometimes deployment team was quite bigger to manage the deployments in multiple environments. With the help of container technologies the deployment whole process became more streamlined and standardized. The container technologies can be used to automate the deployment process quite effortlessly and therefore the value of a well configured container platform is intangible. Docker is a tool to create an image of an application and the dependencies needed to run it. The image can then later be used on a containerization platform such as Kubernetes.
